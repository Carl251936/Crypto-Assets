# Infinity Wallet Crypto Information

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of information from chains and tokens, allowing projects to add their logo, receive custom styles and further information, visible when imported by a user into the Infinity Wallet or other platforms/developers/designers using this repository.

This allows any token to gain additional credibility and a professional feel when manually imported across the ecosystem, while providing them with:
- Custom designed logo of the token [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfinityWallet/Crypto-Assets/main/Cryptos/binancesmartchain/0x2170ed0880ac9a755fd29b2688956bd959f933f8/logo.svg).
